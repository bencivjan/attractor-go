# Claude Code Instructions

## Workflow

- Always commit and push changes incrementally — after each logical unit of work, not in a single large batch at the end.
- Each commit should be focused on one concern (e.g., one file group, one feature, one fix).
- Push after each commit so progress is visible on the remote.
